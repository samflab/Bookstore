Here a list of tasks you could do:

1. Add validation to the form in books.html

2. If you think the pages are too blank, add some impressive backgrounds to it. If you are adding any images, make sure it is not a copyrighted one. Choose the images from unsplash.com or freepik.com or any other equivalent platform.
