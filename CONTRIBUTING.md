Here a list of tasks you could do:

1. Add validation to the form in books.html

2. Make the navbar a little better.

3. If you think the pages are too blank, add some impressive backgrounds to it. If you are adding any images, make sure it is not a copyrighted one. Choose the images from unsplash.com or freepik.com or any other equivalent platform.
